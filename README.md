Plan your day with the Daily Planner App:

This is a simple daily planner which enables you to plan our your work day by the hour.

If the time frame is in the future you will see the text box lights up as a green bar. If it's in the past
you will see a red bar, or the present hour will appear grey. 

This app is built based on momentjs which is an API which enables the developer to make realtime changes to the source code based on the time of day. 

I made this app using Bootstrap interface elements.
